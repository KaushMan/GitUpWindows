To run the executable, you must first download the "GitUp.zip" file here: 
https://www.dropbox.com/sh/9jsd261dos98f6n/AABZnOT4SGWmfYVqMDnTKFSMa?dl=0

Next, unzip GitUp.zip, which should provide an executable called "GitUp" and a git_attributes.txt file.
The git_attributes.txt file needs to be next to the GitUp executable in order for it to maintain it's 
full functionality, so please do not separate these two files.
