- How Easy is GitUp to use?
It looks pretty straightforward to use, definitely more so than Git or GitKraken. I definitely think a new developer would be able to use it fairly quickly. The GUI does look kind of ugly though.

- Does it have all the functionality it needs to have to backup a software project?
Yes.

- What is the most important feature you feel like GitUp should have that it doesn't?
Branches for sure. With GitUp, every change you make affects the main project, whether you
want it to or not. When I code, I like to play around with my code and try things out. More
often than not, I decide that whatever I tried to do wouldn't work well, so I discard my changes
and start over. Other times, I want to try multiple different things at once and see how they
compare with each other. With branches, I can easily partition any experimentation I do, and
only add the changes I want to main. Using GitUp would leave me with a cluttered mess of a project,
and constantly reverting files back to older versions would be a huge pain.
