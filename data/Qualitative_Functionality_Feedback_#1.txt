- How Easy is GitUp to use?
Wayyyy easier to use than Git. It took me two quarters of using Git in my classes to finally
get the hang of it, but I feel like if I had used GitUp, I would have had everything figured out
in minutes!


- Does it have all the functionality it needs to have to backup a software project?
Definitely!

- What is the most important feature you feel like GitUp should have that it doesn't?
I think that you should have more control over what gets pushed and when. I get that automatic
pushing/pulling is a lot easier to use than Git's adding, commiting, and pushing. However, I
personally like to organize my pushes around functionality I implement. I don't see any
easy way of seeing what changes correspond to what functionality, and I feel like choosing
when to push will let a user get more out of their version history.
